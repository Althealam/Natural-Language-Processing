# Natural Language Processing (NLP) 

Welcome to my **NLP Learning Repository**! This repository is dedicated to my journey in learning and experimenting with **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques, specifically focusing on fine-tuning **Hugging Face's BERT** model. 

I am exploring various NLP tasks, and this repository contains code and resources related to these areas:

## Key Learning Areas

1. **Text Classification**: Learning to categorize text into predefined labels (e.g., sentiment analysis, topic classification).
2. **Token Classification**: Understanding tasks like Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging.
3. **Table Question Answering**: Exploring how to extract relevant information from tables in response to questions.
4. **Question Answering**: Working on reading comprehension tasks, extracting precise answers from given passages.
5. **Sentence Similarity**: Measuring the similarity between two sentences for tasks like paraphrase detection.
6. **Text2Text Generation**: Learning models that transform text from one format to another (e.g., translation).
7. **Text Generation**: Generating text continuations, creative writing, or predictive typing.
8. **Feature Extraction**: Extracting numerical features from text that can be used for further analysis.
9. **Summarization**: Condensing long articles or documents into shorter summaries while preserving meaning.
10. **Translation**: Translating text between different languages using state-of-the-art models.

## Tools and Frameworks

- **Hugging Face Transformers**: For pre-trained models and fine-tuning on various NLP tasks.
- **BERT**: Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, which forms the core of my experiments.
